# General Information

BetTogether is a fun side project designed to bring people together through friendly competition. It allows users to create communities with friends and organize custom bets. Users can define their own bets and determine the outcomes later. Additionally, BetTogether offers the ability to create leaderboards, adding a competitive edge to the experience.
There is a public instance available for everyone to use for free, but you also have the option to host it yourself if you prefer.

# Usage & Installation

Its just an laravel app. So the only thing you have to do is follow the [Laravel instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation).


# Framework choice

In my private and professional career I have worked a lot with PHP and especially with the [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com/). But I really like to start learning new things.
Laravel is widely known for its great developer experience and I also wanted to give it a shot. This is the main reason I used it for this project. 

Furthermore, I wanted to learn of the way Laravel handles rendering content and database request. 

# Contribution

If you want to contribute feel free to create a pull request or an issue. There are no real guidelines in this project. Just make sure your code is compliant to the pint and phpstan configuration and actually does work.
I am relatively active on GitHub. Therefore, I am really fast in reacting to pull requests and general project contributions.

# Further development

I am aware of the fact, that this application if very minimalistic. But this is the way I wanted it to be. It should not be a feature blown app that can nearly do anything. 
This would only lead to one thing: The app would be harder to use for the end-user. If there are cool feature ideas, I will implement them, but as main policy I want to keep 
the app as lightweight as possible.
